Users can upload their photos and visualize how different clothes will fit their body type and style preferences.
#### 2. Seamless Shopping Experience
Browse through an extensive collection of traditional and modern clothes, curated to highlight Bangladeshi fashion and style.
#### 3. Personalized Recommendations
The platform uses AI to suggest clothing styles and sizes based on previous user interactions, try-ons, and preferences.
#### 4. Secure Payment and Checkout
A robust and secure payment gateway is integrated for a hassle-free checkout experience, supporting multiple payment methods.
#### 5. Size & Fit Recommendations
Based on previous try-ons and customer data, the system suggests the most appropriate size for each item to minimize returns and increase satisfaction.

### AI Developing Model
#### 1. Data Collection

Clothing Data: High-resolution images of garments from multiple angles.

User-Uploaded Images: Users can upload photos of themselves for virtual try-on.
#### 2. Preprocessing
Image Resizing and Cropping: Adjusting user and clothing images to standard sizes.
Background Removal: Removing backgrounds from clothing images for a clean overlay.
Pose Estimation: Detecting user body poses for accurate clothing alignment.
#### 3. Training the AI Model
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): GANs are used to create realistic try-on images by mapping clothes onto user-uploaded images.
Clothing Warping: Utilizing Geometric Matching Networks (GMN) to fit clothes naturally on the user's body, considering pose and body shape.
#### 4. Model Validation & Fine-Tuning
Validating the model on unseen user images and clothes to refine fit accuracy.
Error correction based on how well the garments appear on the user’s photo.
#### 5. Real-Time Processing
Users upload their images, and the AI generates a real-time virtual try-on result, adjusting the fit and folds of the clothing dynamically.
#### 6. Continuous Learning
Feedback-based improvement: The AI model is continuously improved based on user feedback and behavior during the try-on process.
#### 7. Integration with Personalization
Style recommendations are based on user preferences, while size recommendations minimize returns and improve fit accuracy.
